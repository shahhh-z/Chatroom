This is my implementation of a TCP chatroom and a UDP chatroom.

This program allows users to join the chatroom, exchange messages, and leave.
It also allows the person controlling the server to shut it down by raising a KeyboardInterrupt error (Ctrl+C).

How to run the program:
1. Choose UDP or TCP and update the server and client files accordingly.
2. Open multiple terminals in the folder containing the files.
3. Run the server file.
4. Run the client file in the other terminals.
5. Chat with the clients.
There are more detailed instructions on how to run the files in the server and client files.

Here is a video of the program:
